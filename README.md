# Customize ISO Image For Media Industry User

## Project description
A working **ubuntu** iso image with specific packages for media professionals. This includes providing them with software combinations that are customized to them (such as Photoshop alternatives, video and audio editing, painting tools, etc). We ended up choosing Ubuntu between Debian and Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes with a software called Cubic can be use to customize the iso image. Cubic's interface is simple and straightforward, and every step of customizing the ISO image is comprehensive. It's a more beginner-friendly alternative. Ubuntu also offers the advantage of having Ubuntu Studio, which integrates photo, video, and audio editing functions. In general.
